# Recipe Book Application

## Overview

This application simulates a book effect for creating recipes, guiding users through a series of steps to create a complete recipe. It utilizes a modern web technology stack to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Goals

- Demonstrate a book effect in a web application interface.
- Guide users through the recipe creation process in an intuitive and engaging manner.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: React Bootstrap, Sass

## User Experience Flow

1. **Create Recipe Button**: Users start the recipe creation process by clicking the "Create Recipe" button.
2. **Cover Page**: Users enter the recipe name and description on a form presented on the cover page.
3. **Search and Add Ingredients**: Users can search for and add ingredients from a list. This stage simulates the process of gathering ingredients for the recipe.
4. **Adding Instructions**: Users input step-by-step instructions for preparing the recipe.
5. **Submit and Close**: After submitting the recipe, the book effect closes, marking the completion of the recipe creation process.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Data Persistence**: Integration with a backend API is required for storing recipe data persistently. The frontend code is prepared for this integration.
- **Ingredients Page**:
  - An API is needed for ingredient search functionality to replace the current hardcoded list.
  - Implementation of the remove button functionality is pending.
  - UI enhancements are recommended for improving the visual appeal and usability.
- **UI Enhancements**: General improvements to the user interface can further enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
